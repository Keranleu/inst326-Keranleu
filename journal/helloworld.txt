Week 1 

Week 2 

As i was completing the 30 practice problems, I ran into issues with replacing and pretty much anything the required to munipulate strings. I used AI to help me break down the logic on how it works in pseudocode and generate some easy practice problems. 

Week 3 

Pretty much did that same this as week two. I would try out the problem at first 
and if i couldn't do it or had too much trouble i would ask chatgpt for help. besides that 
i only used it for syntax errors.

I missed both class sessions due to all of the career fair so i pretty much
asked ai to coach me throught all of the problems. 
I was able to get alot of them but not all though.

w5
This week was more less the same. Just using ai to help with alot of syntax
errors. None the less pretty simple work(relatively of course)

w6
This was one of the hardest sets so far and too me the longest
I only used ai when i really needed it and ask it to coach me thorught all the problems .
