Week 1 

Week 2 

As i was completing the 30 practice problems, I ran into issues with replacing and pretty much anything the required to munipulate strings. I used AI to help me break down the logic on how it works in pseudocode and generate some easy practice problems. 

Week 3 

Pretty much did that same this as week two. I would try out the problem at first 
and if i couldn't do it or had too much trouble i would ask chatgpt for help. besides that 
i only used it for syntax errors.

I missed both class sessions due to all of the career fair so i pretty much
asked ai to coach me throught all of the problems. 
I was able to get alot of them but not all though.
